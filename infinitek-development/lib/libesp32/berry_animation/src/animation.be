# Berry Animation Framework - Main Entry Point
# 
# This is the central module that imports and registers all animation framework components
# into a unified "animation" object for use in Infinitek LED strip control.
#
# The framework provides:
# - DSL (Domain Specific Language) for declarative animation definitions  
# - Value providers for dynamic parameters (oscillators, color providers)
# - Event system for interactive animations
# - Optimized performance for embedded ESP32 systems
#
# Usage in Infinitek:
#   import animation
#   var engine = animation.create_engine(strip)
#   var pulse_anim = animation.pulse(animation.solid(0xFF0000), 2000, 50, 255)
#   engine.add(pulse_anim).start()
#
# Launch standalone with: "./berry -s -g -m lib/libesp32/berry_animation"

# Import Infinitek integration if available (for embedded use)
import global
if !global.contains("Infinitek")
  import Infinitek
end

# Create the main animation module and make it globally accessible
# The @solidify directive enables compilation to C++ for performance
#@ solidify:animation,weak
var animation = module("animation")
global.animation = animation

# Version information for compatibility tracking
# Format: 0xAABBCCDD (AA=major, BB=minor, CC=patch, DD=build)
animation.VERSION = 0x00010000

# Convert version number to human-readable string format "major.minor.patch"
def animation_version_string(version_num)
  if version_num == nil version_num = animation.VERSION end
  var major = (version_num >> 24) & 0xFF
  var minor = (version_num >> 16) & 0xFF
  var patch = (version_num >> 8) & 0xFF
  return f"{major}.{minor}.{patch}"
end
animation.version_string = animation_version_string
