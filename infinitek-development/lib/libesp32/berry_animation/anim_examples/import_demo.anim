# Import Demo - Demonstrates DSL import functionality
# This example shows how to import user functions and use them in animations

# Import user functions module
import user_functions

# Create animations that use imported user functions
animation random_red = solid(color=red)
random_red.opacity = user.rand_demo()

animation breathing_blue = solid(color=blue) 
breathing_blue.opacity = max(50, min(255, user.rand_demo() + 100))

animation dynamic_green = solid(color=green)
dynamic_green.opacity = abs(user.rand_demo() - 128) + 64

# Create a sequence that cycles through the animations
sequence import_demo {
  play random_red for 3s
  play breathing_blue for 3s  
  play dynamic_green for 3s
}

# Run the demo
run import_demo
